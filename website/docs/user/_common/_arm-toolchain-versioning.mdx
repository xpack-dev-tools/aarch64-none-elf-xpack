## Versioning

The version string used by the
upstream **Arm GNU Toolchain** project is a bit unusual and unstable in time,
(like <code>{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.Rel1</code>)
therefore the upstream GCC version is preferred, which
is a three number string
like <code>14.2.1</code>;
to this string the xPack distribution adds a fourth number that represents
the Arm release with the same GCC release, and a fifth number
that represents the xPack release of the same Arm release;
since [SemVer](https://semver.org) allows only three numbers,
all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like <code>14.2.1-<b>1.1</b></code>. When
published as a npm package, the version gets
a sixth number,
like <code>14.2.1-1.1.<b>1</b></code>.

Since adherence of third party packages to SemVer is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referring to the xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC dependency via
a SemVer expressions
like <code>^14.2.1-1.1</code> or <code>~14.2.1-1.1</code>, and
prefer exact matches,
like <code>14.2.1-1.1.1</code>.
